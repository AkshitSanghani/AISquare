# Akshit Sanghani - AISquare Assignment

This repository contains the implementation of the AISquare assignment by Akshit Sanghani. The project is structured to ensure maintainability, scalability, and clarity. Below is an overview of the key updates.

## Project Structure

### 1. `assets/`
- **Purpose:** A dedicated folder to store images and other media files required for the project.
- **Usage:** Place all static files such as images, icons, videos, and other assets in this folder to maintain a clean and organized structure.

### Key Updates:
- A new `assets/` folder has been created to centralize and manage all media files efficiently.
- The `components/` folder is organized into three logical sections: `header`, `body`, and `footer` to promote modularity and ease of maintenance.
